# Scroll Lock for Firefox

This plugin locks the scroll bar, preventing unwanted scrolling. You can lock or unlock the scrollbar at will, through the plugin menu, on a per-tab basis. I made this to solve the problem of a full-screen app not locking your mouse to that screen, and unintentionally scrolling a video you may be watching on a 2nd monitor. However, please feel free to share your own use cases for this plugin so that I can create a better description/suggestions :)

## Installation

This plugin is [available on the addon store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/scroll-lock/). This plugin can now be installed and enjoyed from there!

## Notes

- I hope you find some use for this! Please let me know what you end up using this for, if you do.
