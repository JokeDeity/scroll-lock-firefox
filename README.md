# Scroll Lock for Firefox

This plugin locks the scroll bar, preventing unwanted scrolling. You can lock or unlock the scrollbar at will, through the plugin menu, on a per-tab basis. I made this to solve the problem of a full-screen app not locking your mouse to that screen, and unintentionally scrolling a video you may be watching on a 2nd monitor. However, please feel free to share your own use cases for this plugin so that I can create a better description/suggestions :)

## Installation

This plugin is not yet on the Add-on store. When it is, this will be updated. This is, of course, only compatible with Firefox as of now.

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in your browser window.
3. Click `Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦`
4. Select any file inside the repo's directory. You can now test out this plugin!

## Notes

- I have full intentions of uploading this plugin to the Add-on store. This installation process is temporary, and when it is uploaded to the store, I will link that here instead.
- I hope you find some use for this! Please let me know what you end up using this for, if you do.
